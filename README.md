# Cube intersection problem

This is my solution for Cube intersection problem.

I used these design patters library:
  - Test Driven Design (TDD).

And these NuGet packages:
  - xUnit: Accelerates the creation of Unit tests.
  - Fluent assertions: Improves readability of asserts.
  - AutoFixture: Random test data generator.

## How to execute
  - Open the project with Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise, go to the 'Test' menu, and select 'Run all tests'
  - This library was tested in a computer with Windows 11 21H2.
